## Overview

Building with Softgen.ai follows an iterative process that transforms your ideas into working applications through AI-powered development.

### Step 1: Project Description

Start by describing your project vision. Be clear and specific about:
- Core functionality
- Target users
- Key features
- Design preferences

<Tip>
  Break down complex applications into smaller components. Start with core features and expand incrementally.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Iterative Development

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Describe Component">
    Begin with one component or page at a time. For example, if building a project management tool, start with the dashboard:
    ```text
    Create a dashboard with:
    - Project overview cards
    - Task status charts
    - Upcoming deadlines
    - Team activity feed
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Review Generated Code">
    Softgen will generate the complete code for your component, including:
    - Frontend UI components
    - Backend logic
    - Database schema
    - API endpoints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="Iterate and Refine">
    Provide feedback to refine the implementation:
    - Request UI improvements
    - Add new features
    - Fix issues
    - Optimize performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Integration

Once individual components are complete, Softgen will help you:
- Connect components together
- Set up authentication
- Configure database
- Implement payment processing
- Enable email functionality
